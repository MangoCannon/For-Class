## The M1A2 Abrams
The M1A2 Abrams is definitely one of the **coolest pieces of technology ever created** with its:
  - 120mm Main cannon
  - Composite Armor
  - 1500hp Jet Turbine Engine
  - Fire Control Systems
  - Hard Kill Active Protection Systems 

> This monster of a tank weighs over 65 tons but can still reach speeds of 40mph while having the ability to come to a full stop in a few feet. 
>In the tanks first combat test during the Persian Gulf War there were 0 American fatalities due to enemy action, and 0 Abrams tanks were lost due to enemy fire. 

There are however a few shortcomings:
  - Costs a pretty penny to make
  - Only gets a mile to the gallon _but it can run off almost any fuel as well as some adult beverages_
  - Is very loud

But these shortcomings are not enough to make this vechile a bad one or even just a good one. 
It is and always will be the ***Coolest and most awesome tank*** at least until we stop doing upgrade packagesand finally make a M1A3 desgin we like.
